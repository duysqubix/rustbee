# How to Contribute

## Getting Help
To ask questions about the Xbee Rust Library to our [discord][discord] server

## Reporting a bug
The way to report bugs is to use the GitHub issue tracker. Before reporting a bug, please read the following points:

1. Make sure that it is really a bug by checking documentation (very little docs at this point) and consulting our FAQ section (also not done)
2. If you still think you have found abug, make sure someone has not already reported it. See list of known [issues][issues].
3. If is has not been reported yet, create a new issue. Make sure to add enough detail so that the bug can be reproduced.

__Note__: The issue tracker is for bugs, not requests for help. Questions should be asked on the [discord][discord] server.

## Contributing Code
1. Fork the [Rustbee][rustbee] Library repository ([how to fork a repo][htfar])
2. Create a branch for your contribution. Use a name that defines the purpose of the additions/modifications.
3. Make your changes following the code style used in the library
4. Addd the corresponding unit tests for the new code
5. Make sure all tests pass
6. Submit a pull request. A project developer will review your work and then merge your request into the project, or come back to you with comments and/or questions.
